          <h2>PEACE BUILDING PROJECT</h2>
          <p>
            Khalid Khatri and his team conducted ‘Peace-Building Sessions’ in
            underprivileged areas, including rural and slum communities. During
            these sessions, they educated the youth about conflict resolution,
            social harmony, and government welfare schemes.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the key impacts of this initiative was the registration of 20
            women under the government’s “Berojgari Bhatta” scheme, which
            supports unemployed individuals with financial aid. These women are
            now receiving regular income through the scheme, helping them become
            financially independent.

          <h2>BLANKET DISTRIBUTION FOR WINTER</h2>
          <p>
          To support the homeless and underprivileged communities during the harsh winter, Khalid Khatri took the initiative to distribute blankets in various regions of Rajasthan. With the funds raised, his team provided warm blankets to over 50 families struggling to survive in extreme cold conditions.
          </p>
          <p>
          This initiative ensured that the elderly, children, and daily wage workers had protection against the winter chills.

          <h2>HELMET DISTRIBUTION FOR ROAD SAFETY
          </h2>
          <p>
          Understanding the increasing road accidents and fatalities, Khalid Khatri launched a Helmet Distribution and Road Safety Awareness Campaign. His team conducted workshops in schools, colleges, and local markets to educate youth and daily commuters on the importance of wearing helmets and following traffic rules.


          </p>
          <p>
          As part of the campaign, over 100 helmets were distributed to students, delivery riders, and workers who frequently travel on two-wheelers but cannot afford safety gear.
          </p>
          <p>This project aimed to create a culture of responsible riding and road safety awareness.</p>
